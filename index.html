<h3>The evolution of Hymenoptera</h3>
<p>Alex Pinch, October 2025<br>

Hymenoptera are an order of insects including bees, wasps, ants, and sawflies. Here I outline the major events in the fossil record, and where this agrees with phylogenomic studies of extant taxa. <br><br>
<b>The broad groups, and a simple-ish overview</b><br>
Hymenoptera are an order of insects including bees, wasps, ants, and sawflies. Their fossil record is sparse, owing much to the preservation of organisms in amber. Here, I outline the major events in their evolution, observable from the fossil record, and where these findings agree with phylogenomic studies of extant taxa.<br>

Below is the body outline of a sawfly. There are two suborders in Hymenoptera, Symphyta and Apocrita. Sawflies belong to the former, a paraphyletic group that appears basal to the more derived body forms in Apocrita. This body-plan gives us a good idea of what the ancestral Hymenopterans looked like.<br>
<img src="https://www.bumblebee.org/invertebrates/images/Urocerus-gigas.jpg"><br>
A few of the important extant superfamilies in Symphyta include Tenthredinoidea, Xyeloidea, and Orussoidea. Tenthredinoidea has been thought of as the oldest symphytan lineage, however Xyeloidea has emerged as the crown-group in some molecular tip-dating studies (Zhang et al., 2024). Parasitism is thought to have originally evolved within the symphytan group Orussoidea, and then subsequently lost and secondarily gained in more derived groups. Every bee, wasp, or ant you know and love is in the second derived suborder, Apocrita.<br>
<img width= 500 px src="wikipedia.png "><br>
Apocrita contains a staggering diversity of species. Within it are the more common extant species, such as European honey bee (Apis mellifera), Western Yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), and black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus). The group is also home to some of the most complex forms of parasitism, as well as eusociality (the strict caste social structure of queens and workers), which has independently evolved a few times (Zhang et al., 2024). Within the parasitic superfamily Ichneumonoidea, there are more species than vertebrates (Gould, 1983). That’s more species of this type of wasp than mammals, fish, birds, and reptiles, combined.<br>

<b>How old are they?</b><br>
Molecular tip-dating puts the origin of Hymenopterans in the middle to early Permian (280MYA) (Misof et al., 2014). <br>
Perhaps a rather important tangent: Alexander Rasnitsyn in 1988 divided Hymenoptera into four infraorders, which is kind of like a superfamily if it was almost an order. These were made up a while ago now, but despite the advancements in molecular genomic work, these classifications still hold up. I figured I’d introduce you to them here, ther are: Ichneumonomorpha, Proctotrupomorpha, Evaniomorpha, and Vespomorpha (also known as Aculeata) (Rasnitstyn, 1988).<br><br>

<b>The first radiation event</b><br>
Jouault et al. (2025) attempted to classify diversification and extinction events in Hymenoptera by integrating phylogenomic data with the fossil record. Using a Bayesian Brownian Bridge (BBB) model, they were able to estimate the ages of groups based on the fossil record, without having to calibrate morphological traits. These estimates were then compared to previous findings in phylogenomic data.
They identified the first major radiation event to after the Permo-Triassic extinction. The environment at this time would have been gymnosperm dominated, and the fossil record shows lots of symphytan groups without body parts specialized for parasitism. <br><br>

<b>Quick tangent:</b> <i>Avioxyella gallica</i> is a key fossil taxa, and belongs to Apatohymenoptera. It is perhaps one of the earliest examples of a holometabolous  insect, or an insect that undergoes whole-metamorphosis. However, it has proved difficult to place in Hymenoptera morphologically and Jouault et al. (2025) had to exclude it from Hymenoptera in their BBB model.<br><br>

<b>A primer to what’s coming: the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution</b><br>
During the Triassic, we see a diversification in body-plan in the fossil record, and the emergence of Apocrita. This is referred to as the first stage in the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution (MMPR). Despite the name, this huge era in hymenopteran development encompasses the Mesozoic, as we see the development and subsequent turnover of a few key taxa. This earliest parasitoid was the common ancestor between Orussoidea, within Symphyta, and Apocrita. This wasp-ancestor was likely a parasite of wood-boring beetle larvae, and was an idiobiont, meaning it immobilized their host early in development (Zhang et al., 2024). This relatively simple strategy is a far cry from the complex forms of parasitism across Apocrita today, including koinobionts (where the parasite is able to ‘hitch a ride’ and not immobilize their host), kleptoparasitism (where a parasite hijacks another species mother to raise its young, like a cuckoo bird), and even hyperparasitoidism (a parasite of a parasite!).<br><br>

Some of these apocritan fossils have been placed in extant parasitoid superfamilies, and molecular dating confirms that Parasitoida, the earliest parasitoid group, is likely to have arisen here in the Triassic. Parasitoida includes Proctotrupomorpha, Ceraphronoidea, and Ichneumonoidea (Zhang et al., 2024).<br><br>

<b>The earliest Tenthredinoid</b><br>
Tenthredinoidea, the most basal superfamily within Symphyta, and has its earliest fossil evidence in the Bascharage locality, where <i>Pseudoxyelocerus bascharagensis</i> was found (Nel et al., 2004). It’s part of the extant family Blasticotomidae.<br>

<b> Tangent:</b> It’s cute.<br>

<b>The earliest Orussoid</b><br>
The earliest Orussoidea fossils (to recap, a parasitic symphytan or sawfly, without a wasp-waist), belong to the mid-Jurassic Mikhailovka locality. They belong to the family Paraorussidae, and are one of the early examples of a modified ovipositor for parasitism.<br><br>

<b>Snatching the waist</b><br>
One feature of wasps that you may have noted absent in the sawfly diagram is a small waist. The earliest evidence of this characteristic feature in the fossil record is in a Ephialtitid specimen from the Middle Jurassic, which contains this two-segmented petiole (Li et al., 2015). Below, you can see a photograph of Acephialtitia colossa, one of three species described from this Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation by. Perhaps a bit hard to tell, but that abdomen has some articulation in it, suggesting this apocritan could move it’s waist.<br><br>
<img width = 500px src="ephialtitid_li2025.png "><br><br>
<b>Tangent, again:</b> Rasnitysn was involved in this paper by Li et al. (2015). He’s come up before, and I figured it’d be worthwhile to take a second to talk about this living legend in paleoentomology. Alexandr Rasnitsyn did the first time-trees for Hymenoptera based solely on the fossil record (Zhang et al., 2024). His has described many specimens from all over the world and formally described 800 species. He doesn’t like cladism, had a good hunch for the origin of insect flight (as a means of gliding) which has since been supported in Yanoviak et al. (2009), lives in Moscow, and is 89 years old (Brothers, 2011). Thank you, Dr. Rasnitsyn.<br><br>

<b>MMPR: Phase two</b><br>
The second phase of the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution takes place in the late Jurassic. Here, we have the diversification of a few extinct families. Evanoidea is a classic example of a group who was more diverse than today, with five of eight families now extinct. Ephialtitidae also went extinct by the Cretaceous and before the third major event in the MMPR. We see diversification in some of the oldest groups of Apocrita: Stephanoidea, Roproniidae, and Megalyridae (Zhang et al., 2024).<br><br>

<b>MMPR: Phase three</b><br>
This event is called a ‘turn-over’, where we see some extant groups become more common and the diversified families of the late Jurassic begin to wane. Chalcidoidea, Chrysidoidea, Ichneumonidae, and Braconidae, all extant parasitoid groups, become characteristic at this time. Chaclidoidea, which contain modern hyperparasitoids, also diversify at this time (Zhang et al., 2024).<br>
<img width = 500px src="https://i.etsystatic.com/34315168/r/il/cb506b/4861017169/il_1588xN.4861017169_p1s0.jpg"><br><br>

<b>Flowers!</b><br>
During the Mesozoic, plants start to utilize the many emerging insect species around them. The odd plant benefits when an insect lands on it, accidentally carrying the pollen nearby, increasing the likelihood of fertilization. Some gymnosperms start to leak resin out of their bark, and some other plants secrete sugary nectar. Early hymenopterans lap these up, sometimes getting trapped within the resin and preserved in what becomes amber. The ones that don’t start a chain of events that shapes the world as we know it today.<br><br>
<img width = 500px src="flower.png "><br>
If you’re a plant, one way to get insects to collect your pollen is to attract them with nectar, but you’ve also got to grab their attention. Flowers are a plant’s way of attracting insects for pollination. And when these angiosperms show up in the fossil record, so do bees.<br>
The emergence of flowers, or the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution, allowed some non-parasitic hymenopterans to specialize on collecting flower nectar. This new source of nectar and pollen was so energy-rich, it allowed some hymenopterans to start provisioning their young, perhaps as a stepping-stone to eusociality. One group even lost carnivory (I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way here, the plant-eating sawfly-looking ancestors transitioned to carnivory), which makes up the monophyletic ‘anthophila’. Anthophila means anther-loving (the part of the plant that contains the pollen), and these are the modern bees. However, even within bees we see more diversity in lifestyle, such as having secondarily gained parasitism, and gained and then lost eusociality (Danforth, Minckley, and Neff, 2019).<br><br>
It has been estimated that, due to our reliance on bees to pollinate our crops, 1 in 3 bites is possible with the work of bees (USDA, n.d.). I’d hate to try to justify this fascinating and tangled trajectory with a fact about how much we rely on hymenopterans, but I feel it important to stress: we need them. As much as joy can be gained from measuring body parts in rocks, these early hymenopterans are the reason we have flowers today. They are the reason we can allocate swaths of land in to crops that, without them, would fail to produce fruit.<br><br>

<b>The peak.</b><br>
Jouault et al. (2025) estimate the peak in Hymenopteran diversity occurred in the Cretaceous. Their Bayesian Brownian Bridge model is likely biased by the abundance of amber fossils at this time. However, it’s likely (and beautiful) that this was caused pretty directly by the evolution of angiosperms. Hymenopterans moulded (or at least capitalized) their world, from struggling to articulate their ovipositor into ancient gymnosperm wood, to escaping their phytophagous origins, to encouraging the diversification of flower morphology and providing themselves with the abundance needed to brood for their children.<br><br>
