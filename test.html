<b>The broad groups, and a simple-ish overview</b><br>
Hymenoptera are an order of insects including bees, wasps, ants, and sawflies. Their fossil record is sparse, owing much to the preservation of organisms in amber. Here, I outline the major events in their evolution, observable from the fossil record, and where these findings agree with phylogenomic studies of extant taxa.

Below is the body outline of a sawfly. There are two suborders in Hymenoptera, Symphyta and Apocrita. Sawflies belong to the former, a paraphyletic group that appears basal to the more derived body forms in Apocrita. This body-plan gives us a good idea of what the ancestral Hymenopterans looked like.

A few of the important extant superfamilies in Symphyta include Tenthredinoidea, Xyeloidea, and Orussoidea. Tenthredinoidea has been thought of as the oldest symphytan lineage, however Xyeloidea has emerged as the crown-group in many fossil date calibrating studies (Zhang et al., 2023). Parasitism is thought to have originally evolved within the symphytan group Orussoidea, and then subsequently lost and secondarily gained in more derived groups. Every bee, wasp, or ant you know and love is in the second derived suborder, Apocrita.<br>

Apocrita contains a staggering diversity of species. Within it are the more common extant species, such as European honey bee (Apis mellifera), Western Yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), and black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus). The group is also home to some of the most complex forms of parasitism, as well as eusociality (the strict caste social structure of queens and workers), which has independently evolved a few times (Zhang et al., 2023). Within the parasitic superfamily Ichneumonoidea, there are more species than vertebrates (Gould, 1983). That’s more species of this type of wasp than mammals, fish, birds, and reptiles, combined.<br>

<b>How old are they?</b><br>
Molecular tip-dating puts the origin of Hymenopterans in the middle to early Permian (280MYA) (Misof et al., 2014). <br><br>

<b>The first radiation event</b><br>
Jouault et al. (2025) attempted to classify diversification and extinction events in Hymenoptera by integrating phylogenomic data with the fossil record. Using a Bayseian Brownian Bridge model, they were able to estimate the ages of groups based on the fossil record, without having to calibrate morphological traits. These estimates were then compared to previous findings in phylogenomic data.
They identified the first major radiation event to after the Permo-Triassic extinction. The environment at this time would have been gymnosperm dominated, and the fossil record shows lots of symphytan groups without body parts specialized for parasitism. <br><br>

<b>The Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution</b><br>
During the Triassic, we see a diversification in body-plan in the fossil record, and the emergence of Apocrita. This is referred to as the first stage in the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution. Despite the name, this huge era in hymenopteran development encompasses the Mesozoic, as we see the development and subsequent turnover of a few key taxa. This earliest parasitoid was the common ancestor between Orussoidea, within Symphyta, and Apocrita. This wasp-ancestor was likely a parasite of wood-boring beetle larvae, and was an idiobiont, meaning it immobilized their host early in development (Zhang et al., 2023). This relatively simple strategy is a far cry from the complex forms of parasitism across Apocrita today, including koinobionts (where the parasite is able to ‘hitch a ride’ and not immobilize their host), kleptoparasitism (where a parasite hijack’s another species mother to raise its young, like a cuckoo bird), and even hyperparasitoidism (where a parasite evolves it’s own parasite).

Some of these apocritan fossils have been placed in extant parasitoid superfamilies, and molecular dating confirms that Parasitoida, the earliest parasitoid group, is likely to have arisen here in the Triassic. Parasitoida includes Proctotrupomorpha, Ceraphronoidea, and Ichneumonoidea (Zhang et al., 2023).

<b>Flowers!</b><br>
During the Mesozoic, plants start to utilize the many emerging insect species around them. The odd plant benefits when an insect lands on it, accidentally carrying the pollen nearby, increasing the likelihood of fertilization. Some gymnosperms start to leak resin out of their bark, and some other plants secrete sugary nectar. Early hymenopterans lap these up, sometimes getting trapped within the resin and preserved in what becomes amber. The ones that don’t start a chain of events that shapes the world as we know it today.<br><br><br>

If you’re a plant, one way to get insects to collect your pollen is to attract them with nectar, but you’ve also got to grab their attention. Flowers are a plant’s way of attracting insects for pollination. And when these angiosperms show up in the fossil record, so do bees.<br>
The emergence of flowers, or the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution, allowed some non-parasitic hymenopterans to specialize on collecting flower nectar. This new source of nectar and pollen was so energy-rich, it allowed some hymenopterans to start provisioning their young, perhaps as a stepping-stone to eusociality. One group even lost carnivory (I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way here, the plant-eating sawfly-looking ancestors transitioned to carnivory), which makes up the monophyletic ‘anthophila’. Anthophila means anther-loving (the part of the plant that contains the pollen), and these are the modern bees. However, even within bees we see more diversity in lifestyle, such as having secondarily gained parasitism, and gained and then lost eusociality (Danforth, Minckley, and Neff, 2019).<br><br>
